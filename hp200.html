      <h2>HP 200 Final Reflection:</h2>
      <p>The class HP 200 tackles a plethora of relevant issues commonly found within our society today. It tackles privilege, dispositions, leadership, poverty, social capital and climate change just to name a few. However, I believe the overall lesson the class teaches is how to be a globally aware, good human being. <br><br>
	Although many of the topics covered in class I already felt I had a good understanding of, I often found myself learning different perspectives on topics, and sometimes learning about myself. For instance, in the beginning of class we tackled the topic of dispositions and privilege. Initially, I thought I already knew all there was to know about my privilege, and thought of myself as a generally open-minded man. However, through readings such as “Invisible Backpack” by Peggy McIntosh, I found there are aspects of my privilege I have never even considered, and further raised my awareness of the troubles minorities may face. Furthermore, I still believe I am a very open-minded individual (especially by today's standards), however through reflection assignments I was able to see for the first time how far I have come. Through these assignments I revisited old memories and conversations I had with friends, and was able to acknowledge how my foresight on others' dispositions and perspectives has progressed overtime. Most importantly, I could see how I have grown to become aware of my own dispositions, which allow me to become even more open-minded, and also understand people's perspectives better, especially of those raised in a culture different than mine. <br><br>
	Lastly, through this class I have learned the correlation between leadership and service, and was able to link this with real community engagement projects I was involved in that were prompted through the class. The traits of a stereotypical leader are well known, passionate, assertive, and usually very good at public speaking in order to mobilize a large group of people. However, unknown to most there lies a more subtle and arguably more realistic form of leadership that everyone should praise. That is servant leadership. I may not agree with the term “servant” but the underlying idea of this type of leadership reigns high in my mind. This is a type of leadership, where in order to attack a problem you are passionate about, you find those educated to attack the problem, or those effected by the problem, and listen closely to their advice on how to make real change, then follow through by donating time fighting against the problem in a meaningful way. I was able to do this myself by attacking the underlying problem of climate change by volunteering time to a Clarkson graduate student who is conducting research aiding in the fight against climate change.<br><br>

      <h2>Personal Statment:</h2>
      <p>The way that I approach service is on the basis of, how can I be as helpful as possible. Everyone wants to think they would be able to create a breakthrough in a long lasting social issue by volunteering. Yet, often what happens instead is volunteers get tedious small tasks that seem unimportant to the volunteers, but are actually the most impactful when it comes to helping the cause. Therefore my philosophy in service is to ask, “how can I help?” Then do whatever job they assign me to the best of my capabilities. I believe leadership can play a big role in this mindset, just by taking pride in doing the annoying but necessary tasks to help whatever cause you support can encourage the people around you, and remind them that what they are doing is helping, and is making an impact. This mindset was especially prevalent through my service helping Clarkson graduate student Maddie LoDico with her carbon sequestration project. The tasks I and a small group of honors students were assigned was going to various plots of land in forests, and taking inventory of trees. A plot could have 5 trees, or up to 30 trees, and we as a group needed to measure the circumference, identify the species, and record various other data in order to aid Maddie in her research. Although this may have been repetitive, and seem insignificant against the fight in climate change, the volunteer work me and the rest of the group did expedited Maddie’s research significantly. And through aiding Maddie and her research, we are indirectly helping Clarkson University in their goal of becoming net carbon neutral by 2025 which has a much greater impact on climate change (especially locally) than any solo project I could have done using the same amount of time. Overall, I plan to continue this mindset throughout my future service, always ensuring I am helping in the most impactful way possible, setting a good role model and inspiring others to do the same.
