      <h2>HP 201 Major Takeaways:</h2>
      <p>Through the class HP 201 we dove into a cornucopia of media and literature. The media covered a plethora of topics, but prominently featured aspects of climate change or futurism. The one commonality all forms of media and literature we consumed in the class had was that they all try to communicate a risk. This communication of risk by various media and literature was the main focus of this class.<br><br>
	The methods of communicating risk are endless, but not all equally effective. It was common knowledge within the scientific community that burning fossil fuels leads to global warming years before the general public fully got acquainted with the idea. The scientists were even freely communicating this risk of global warming to the public through research papers and studies. However, due to the lack of accessibility of a research paper (mostly through technical jargon, and reading difficulty) most messages from this community are overlooked by the general public. On the other hand you have mediums such as social media, movies, or TV that are able to communicate messages rapidly at an enormous scale, but with much less credibility. It is the connection from one medium (academic paper), to other mediums (movies and news articles) that create effective risk communication to a wide audience.<br><br>
 Nevertheless, the reach of your message is fruitless if the audience perceives the message wrong. This is where the topic of risk perception arises, which is the idea that everyone perceives risk differently due to their life experiences. Although a climate fiction film may be effective at inspiring a highschooler to work in green energy, it also may be equally as effective at giving a college graduate a sense of climate doom, making them perceive any efforts to address climate change hopeless. Scientists were even able to create theories of understanding, enabling us to even further understand how audiences perceive risks through media.<br><br>
	Overall, risk communication is how society is able to communicate with itself on various problems throughout the world, and means of addressing them. To communicate risk effectively one must consider the means of communication, the target audience, and how different audiences will perceive this information. Only through a careful consideration of all these things may a risk be communicated in the most effective manner.
